## <i class="fa fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i> Linux
I have been running [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) on my Personal PC since 1999, starting with [Mandrake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux)

I am comfortable running and managing Linux servers and [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) containers.

## <i class="fa fa-rss" aria-hidden="true"></i> Communication
I enjoy talking and debating about technical concerns. I blog about technical topics and session feedback from conferences.
I also enjoy presenting technical topics in forums. I am comfortable running technical meetings and finding solutions around a white board.
